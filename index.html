# Building Your Own Federated Search 

https://trott.github.io/building-your-own-federated-search

???

Let's talk about building your own federated search.

---

class: center, middle

# What

???

Before we build it, I guess we ought to know what it is.

---

class: center, middle

<img alt="" src="img/ghostbusted.svg" width="600" height="600">

???

For starters, it's not metasearch, which I guess means I better take ten seconds to distinguish between federated search and metasearch.

---

class: center, middle

# Metasearch: one index, multiple resources

???

Metasearch operates on a one consolidated index harvested from multiple sources; Summon and similar products are metasearch tools.

---

class: center, middle

# Federated search: one index per resource

???

Federated search is more like running the same search on ten different search engines all at once and getting ten different result sets.

---

class: center, middle

# There are pros&hellip;

???

Reasons you might want to do this instead of metasearch include&hellip;

---

class: center, middle

# $

???

&hellip;higher cost for implementing metasearch&hellip;

---

class: center, middle

# Extensibility 

???

&hellip;and flexibility to include pretty much anything you can search rather than only things for which you have access to complete metadata.

---

class: center, middle

# There are cons&hellip;

???

There are disadvantages to be aware of.

---

class: center, middle

# Multiple result sets

???

Getting ten different result sets can be overwhelming compared to a single, sorted result set.

---

class: center, middle

# But really, why?

???

Let's say you have dozens of online resources and each of these online resources has its own search tool.

---

class: center, middle

# Here are the 387 URLs to try&hellip;

???

But users shouldn't be asked to search in dozens of different interfaces to find what they're looking for.

---

class: center, middle

# Have we mentioned $?

???

You're cash-constrained&hellip;

---

class: center, middle

# Hi, I'm Cyndi Lauper, and I create amazing user experiences.

???

&hellip;or just want to have some fun creating something.

---

class: center, middle

# Let's federate some search already!

???

So your focus is on federated search because it's frankly simpler and cheaper than metasearch.

---

class: center, middle

# 3 Is A Magic Number

Yes it is. It's a magic number.

<small>Somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity, you get 3. That's a magic number.

<small>The past and the present and the future&hellip;

<small>&hellip;faith and hope and charity&hellip;

<small>&hellip;the heart and the brain and the body&hellip;

<small>&hellip;give you 3.

<small>That's a magic number.</small></small></small></small></small></small>

???

There are (at least) three ways to pull data out of other resources in real time, and here they are in descending order of desirability.

---

class: center, middle

# Cool, they have an API for that!

<span class="blink">This almost never happens.</span>

???

Number 1: The content provider might publish an API. 

API is all the hotness now, but still, *this almost never happens*. 

Often what you and I consider an API is not what the content providers consider an API. 

If you give me a script tag that injects a widget into my page, and then you call it an API, *that is not an API*.

But if it turns out an API is available, accessing the content provider's API is the most desirable option.

---

class: center, middle 

# Screen-scrape the #*%!Â out of it.

This is by far the most common scenario.

???

Then there's straightforward grab-the-HTML and scrape the information out of it.

As we all know, it's brittle because the HTML can change and break your scraper. 

But it has two big upsides!

Number 1: It usually works well enough.

And number 2: It is usually easy and fast to implement.

---

class: center, middle 

# Web New-dot-Oh

It's full of JavaScript that injects the content.

???

Lastly, there's what you have to do when confronted with a site powered by front-end technologies.

None of the content shows up unless you execute a bunch of JavaScript.

For this, make friends with headless browsers like PhantomJS to scrape these sites.

This should be your last resort, not your first choice. 

Headless browsers are fast compared to Safari and Internet Explorer, but they're slow compared to curl or API calls.

---

class: center, middle

# Pitfalls

???

When trying to implement these solutions, a common scenario is to build your screen-scraping federated search tool with traditional server-side languages like Java or PHP. 

These strategies and technologies bring with them pitfalls to be avoided. 

---

class: center, middle

# "My solution only works in Drupal!"

???

Here's one!

Our group built a solution years ago that is implemented in Drupal with no external facing API. 

So, if I want to experiment with a different results interface without rewriting the entire scraping engine, I need to write it in Drupal.

This tight coupling prevents experimentation with other technologies or things that don't fit neatly into the Drupal paradigm.

And that sucks.

---

class: center, middle

# JavaScript FTW

???

A lot of the pitfalls can be avoided by following sound software architecture principles. 

But one thing should be uncontroversial:

**&quot;No programming language has a more robust and widely-understood set of conventions and tools for processing blobs of HTML than JavaScript.&quot;**

It's got DOM-handling built right in!

It's got a million battle-tested libraries with simple and powerful jQuery-like selectors!

Its sole reason for existing is the web and HTML!

---

class: center, middle

# Node.js FTW

???

So we decided that it probably made sense to build our federated search server using Node.js.

---

class: center, middle

# Browserify FTW

???

Or maybe even take it a step further and just let your user's browser execute the federated search entirely by itself.

No need to talk to your server!

If it's all just JavaScript, why not?

---

class: center, middle

# Amalgamatic

## https://github.com/ucsf-ckm/amalgamatic

???

First, we wrote a pluggable, extensible federated search tool called Amalgamatic.

Now, remember, this can be used on the server&mdash;a Node.js server&mdash;or in the browser.

---

class: middle

````
# npm install --save amalgamatic amalgamatic-sfx amalgamatic-pubmed
````

???

Either way, you install it with `npm`. 

Here, I'm installing both amalgamatic and a pair of plugins.

We'll get to those in a minute.

---

class: middle

````javascript
// Load Amalgamatic
var amalgamatic = require('amalgamatic');

// Load some plugins to search SFX and PubMed.
var sfx = require('amalgamatic-sfx');
var pubmed = require('amalgamatic-pubmed');

// Add the plugins to Amalgamatic.
amalgamatic.add('sfx', sfx);
amalgamatic.add('pubmed', pubmed);

var callback = function (err, results) {
  if (err) {
    console.dir(err);
  } else {
    results.forEach( function (result) {
      console.log('\nCollection name: ' + result.name);
      console.dir(result.data);
    });
  }
};

// Do a search!
amalgamatic.search({searchTerm: 'medicine'}, callback);
````

???

Now we use `require` to load amalgamatic and the plugins. 

We add the plugins to amalgamatic.

We define a callback to work on the results set.

And now we search!

---
class: center, middle

# Amalgamatic plugins

#### https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/amalgamatic-plugin

???

Now about those plugins.

We wrote the ones that we needed to search the resources we were interested in.

In the course of writing these plugins, we used all three of the techniques described earlier:

API, scraping HTML, and using a headless browser to get JavaScript-generated content.

All the plugins are published via npm and tagged `amalgamatic-plugin` so you can find them at the URL or using `npm search`.

---

class: center, middle

# API server

## Node.js, Express

### https://github.com/Trott/apis.ucsf.edu

???

Third, we used Amalgamatic to expose federated search on our Node.JS-powered API server.

---

class: center, middle

# Federated search prototype

## http://search.library.ucsf.edu/

???

Fourth, we set up a prototype search interface to use that API.

Obligatory HTML5 API shoutout to EventSource! 

If you don't know it, look it up, it rules. 

It's one of the unsung majesticly awesome APIs, powerful and simple, and it doesn't get the attention it deserves.

---

class: center, middle

# Browserified Demo

### http://trott.github.io/demo-amalgamatic-browserify/

???

Lastly, because we could, we used Browserify to create a demo showing how to use Amalgamatic so that all the retrieval and processing happens in the browser</a>&mdash;no need for an intermediary API or search server! 

A small caveat on the Browserify-ed version: One thing the browser couldn't do was launch the headless browser for scraping sites that depend on JavaScript execution to display results. 

So maybe there's another reason to keep that as a last resort technique only.

---

class: middle

````javascript
var amalgamatic = require('amalgamatic');

var sfx = require('amalgamatic-sfx');
sfx.setOptions({
    url: 'http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_ucsf/az'
});

amalgamatic.add('sfx', sfx);

var drupal6 = require('amalgamatic-drupal6');
drupal6.setOptions({
    url: 'http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/www.library.ucsf.edu/search/node'
});
amalgamatic.add('drupal6', drupal6);

&hellip;
````

???

Here's the start of the JavaScript code that our Browserify demo app uses.

Here you can see our cheat.

Instead of using the source we want to scrape directly, we're running it through a free CORS proxy.

There's a few free CORS proxies out there, and I chose CORS Anywhere for my demo.

You don't need this for APIs that send CORS headers.

But for other APIs, and for screen scraping, you'll need some CORS headers added.

---

class: middle

````javascript
var options = {
  searchTerm: searchTerm, // We snarfed this from the form earlier
  
  pluginCallback: function (err, result) {
    var elem = document.getElementById(result.name);
    if (err) {
      elem.textContent = err.message;
    } else {
      if (result.data.length) {
        // Code that inserts results into the DOM
      } else {
        elem.innerHTML = 'No results. :-(';
      }
    }
  }

};

amalgamatic.search(options);
````
???

And here's the code that does the search.

You'll notice here that we're not using a callback in the search call at the bottom.

Instead, there's a plugin callback specified in the options object. 

The plugin callback is called for each plugin when it returns its results.

The global callback, in contrast, runs when all the results return.

Using the plugin callback allows us to show results as they arrive rather than making the user wait for the slowest plugin to return before showing anything.
---

class: middle

`# browserify -o bundle.js main.js`

???

Next, we take that JavaScript, which is in `main.js`, and we bundle it up with Browserify into `bundle.js`.

---

class: middle

````html
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
````

???

Finally, we include the bundle in our HTML file.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/calendar.png" alt="">

???

Now, I've been using amalgamatic for search, but I want to encourage people to think creatively about this.

It can really be used to scrape anything.

So you can basically take something that doesn't have an API, and create your own API.

Like...maybe...this thing.

The much-maligned HTML5DevConf online schedule.

I don't begrudge the conference about this. 

This is a super-affordable conference powered by volunteers and a shoestring budget.

Yesterday, I thought, "If all the people complaining about the schedule would channel that effort towards fixing it, we'd be all set."

---

class: center, middle

### https://github.com/ucsf-ckm/amalgamatic-h5dcsched

???

So I wrote an Amalgamatic plugin for the HTML5DevConf calendar.

And gave it a horrible name.

But the code is straightforward HTML scraping.

---

class: center, middle

### https://github.com/Trott/devconf-calendar

???

Then I wrote a quick browserified page to use the plugin to dump JSON calendar data onto a page.

---

class: center, middle

### http://trott.github.io/devconf-calendar

???

And we can see it here, and hope it works, WiFi-willing.

---

class: center, middle

# Step 3: Profit!

<img src="img/twitter.png" alt="" />

???

Then I tweeted about it and waited for someone to use the data to make a killer calendar interface.

It didn't happen.

To be fair, I tweeted about it just before midnight yesterday, so not a lot of time and diminishing benefits for someone to do the work. 

But you know, maybe next year I'll think of doing this a day ahead of the conference rather than halfway into it.
